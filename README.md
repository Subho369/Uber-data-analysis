# Uber-data-analysis

Hello Data Professionals,
Myself Surojeet Dey a Data Analyst,

Just wrapped up a data project analyzing Uber ride performance â€” and hereâ€™s what I uncovered ðŸ‘‡

I explored trip and driver activity data to identify:
* Operational inefficiencies in ride fulfillment.
* Gaps between ride demand and supply at key time slots.
* Driver performance issues affecting trip completion.

ðŸ“Š The project helped me analyze patterns across:
Time buckets (hourly demand spikes)
Pickup zones (City vs. Airport)

ðŸ’¡ Key impact of this analysis:
* Supports better driver allocation strategy
* Optimizes fleet usage based on demand hotspots
* Highlights areas for training, review, or automation

Tools Used: Power BI, SQL, Excel
Skills Applied: Data cleaning | Time-based segmentation | Driver analysis | Dashboard storytelling
